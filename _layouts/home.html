        <h2>Consulting</h2>
        <p>
          I'm a professional software engineer with over a decade of experience consulting for a wide variety of industries including education, energy, manufacturing, government, and many more.
        </p>
        <p>
          I work mostly with .NET cloud applications, systems design and architecture, and DevOps optimization and migration both as a technical lead and as a developer.
          I currently work independently - hire me to lead your team to better practices, solve a pesky problem, navigate an important change, or simply add a strong, practiced hand in the work you're already doing.
        </p>
        <p>
          I prioritize the needs of you and your team, with extra attention to training, documentation, and understanding, to not leave y'all high or dry when our contract is done.
        </p>
        <p>
          Get in touch <a href="mailto:patrick@pmcvtm.com" style="font-weight: bold;">over email</a> and we can work out how to work together.

        <h2>Mentorship</h2>
        <p>
          I am a practiced and empathetic mentor, manager, and coach, serving both as a technical team lead and managing direct reports for organizations.
          I've helped many folks find a path to promotion, work their way through sticky situations, and explore possibilities as they chart a course for their careers.
        </p>
        <p>
          I offer individual technical mentoring, career advising, and coaching for a sliding scale fee based on need, value, and availability.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you're looking for mentoring, shoot me <a href="mailto:patrick@pmcvtm.com" style="font-weight: bold;">an email</a> and we can see if we're a fit.
