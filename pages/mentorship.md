Throughout my career, after achieving a degree of seniority, I have always served as some form of manager and mentor. Initially I mentored contributors as a technical team lead, and later managing direct reports for both medium and MASSIVE companies and teams, with all levels of bureaucracy in between.

I've helped many folks find a path to promotion, work their way through sticky situations, and explore possibilities as they chart a course for their careers.

Now that I'm independent, I continue to offer that expertise and support on an ad-hoc or repeating basis with folks **anywhere**, not just in my organization. I obviously won't have authority to make change in your organization, but I can offer experienced and empathetic coaching to help you advance your career; working within the systems at your company, or make decisions about what to do and where to go next.

I offer individual career advising, technical mentoring, and coaching for a sliding scale fee based on need, value, and availability.

If you're struggling at work or interested in an outside mentor, shoot me <a href="mailto:patrick@pmcvtm.com" style="font-weight: bold;">an email</a> and we can talk about what you're looking for, and if we're a fit.
