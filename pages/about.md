I am professional software consultant and amateur many other things from and in Austin, Texas. I use he/him pronouns and people call me "Patrick," "Loud Patrick," or by my trail name "Boogerbear."

For many years I worked for Headspring, now part of Accenture, as a tech lead, architect, and engineering manager. I now work as an independent consultant and career mentor

Besides developing software and architecting systems, I make crafts from reclaimed materials, design games, and endeavor other arts. You can see more of that at [loudandabrasive.com](https://loudandabrasive.com).

Away from the desk, I'm often outdoors swimming, gardening, or backpacking short and long distances — I thru-hiked the Appalachian Trail in 2018 and Camino de Santiago del Norte in 2023. Inside you will find me cooking in the kitchen, at a live music show, or bowling.

Don't be a stranger, reach out on social medias or directly [contact me on my main site](https://pmcvtm.com/#contact).
